Robert Reich, a Chancellor’s Professor of Public Policy at UC Berkeley, once stated, “America’s wealthy no longer have any idea how the other half lives. Being rich in today’s America means not having to come across anyone who isn’t.” The truth in this statement was clear; people had lost all connection with the homeless. In order to change this, I took it upon myself to create this app called HERO, which stands for Helping Everyone by Reaching Out. Through this app, volunteers and service workers post photos and stories detailing how they help the underprivileged, and how the less fortunate live on a day-to-day basis. HERO inspires others to assist in the same way, as well as bridge the gap between the fortunate and the needy.
